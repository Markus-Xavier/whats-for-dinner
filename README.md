## Abstract
	This web app was made to help users choose a dish or meal to make. The goal was to complete all itterations and every choose your own adventure!

## Technologies
  - Vanilla Javascript
  - node
  - VSCode


## Install + Setup
	- This app can be accessed by cloning down this repo and opening the index.html file. Usernames and Passwords are stored inside of local storage.



## Contributors
  - [Markus-Xavier Rossio](https://github.com/Markus-Xavier)

## Wins
	- I got through a lot of what I wanted to.
	- I got to research local stroage for the username and password saving
  - My code base in most parts is modular.

## Challenges + Improvements
	- My commits were good in the beginning but started to become more infrequent, this is something that I plan to change in the next project.
	- Due to time management issues there were a couple of bugs left in. 
	- I would like to finish the login functionality and add a recipe save feature. I would also like to work with an actcual backend vs just using local storage.
